# Jekyll Template Framework
___

From now on `Jekyll` will be the engine that will power all templates and fill them with content.

- To run in locally just follow this guide: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
- It DOESN'T require `python pygments`
- It doesn't require any additional  `Jekyll` plugins
